Everything on data table has been submitted. AWS table contains more files, but we are assuming most of those AWS files are not important.

> [!WARNING]  
> m64076_221001_041132-bc1012.5mc.hifi_reads.bam was submitted as ccs_algorithm being 6.3.0 but is on the CSV data table as 6.2.0


> [!NOTE]  
> SRA appears to have changed the filenames of some of these files, turning some dashes into underscores. If someone downloads these files from SRA, they may get different filenames than what we have on record. **The internal filename is still being used as the "index" here, and the SRA filename is in the notes column.**
