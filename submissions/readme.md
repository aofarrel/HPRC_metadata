 

‚úÖ = all files uploaded -- done and dusted -- everything should be fine
	* check what I wrote in the PR description (there may be minor changes you should be aware of)
	* pull in the PR 
	* merge the new `*_updated.csv` file with your master data table
üÖ∞Ô∏è = all files in data table are uploaded, but there are more files in the AWS tables
	* if you're certain nothing is missing from the data table CSV, consider this equivalent to ‚úÖ (unless another emoji is also present)
‚ö†Ô∏è = conflicting/corrupt data exists -- **requires input before merging**
üü° = partially uploaded, full upload may or may not be blocked (the TODO emoji)  
üü† = ready for a upload (partial or full) but not doing that yet due to R3/lack of BioSamples
‚ùì = inconsistencies make confirming status difficult  
‚ùå = issues with data fully block an upload

Known R2 projects not in repo (not exhaustive):
* HiC (all of these ones seem to already be on SRA)
* add_to_index
* HG00733_T2T_UW_HiFi_ONT
* HPRC_REVIO_EA_2023
* NISC_HiFi_TopUp_2022_with_5mC


Inconsistenies we truly do not care about:
* Basically equivalent instrument models like "PacBio Revio" becoming "Revio"
